          “At times, being bipolar can be an all-consuming challenge, requiring
          a lot of stamina and even more courage, so if you’re living with this
          illness and functioning at all, it’s something to be proud of, not
          ashamed of.”

            <b>Carrie Fisher</b> <br />
            <i>October 21, 1956 - December 27, 2016</i>
            <br />
            American actress and writer. Known for her portrayal of Princess
            Leia in the Star Wars films and her career as a book and screenplay
            writer.
            <br />
            <br />
            Carrie Fisher was the daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and movie star
            Debbie Reynolds. Her parents went through a messy public divorse
            when she was a toddler, and she was largely raised by her mother
            (Bauer, 2022). She was known in her family as a bookworm, spending
            her childhood reading classical literature and writing poetry (Bose,
            2020). <br />
            <br />
            Fisher began her acting career at the age of 16, in a Broadway
            revival of <i>Irene.</i> Due to her role in this show and her
            burgeoning acting career, she dropped out of high school. She
            enrolled at London’s Central School of Speech and Drama and Sarah
            Laurence College, and left both before graduating (Bauer, 2022).
            Fisher made her film debut in <i>Shampoo</i> (1975), and was cast as
            Princess Leia Organa in the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise, which
            premiered two years later. She has since portrayed Leia in four
            other <i>Star Wars</i> films, the last being released posthumously
            (Bauer, 2022). <br />
            <br />
            In 1987, Fisher published her first novel,{" "}
            <i>Postcards From The Edge</i>, to critical acclaim. The book, which
            satirized real-life events such as her drug addiction, became a
            bestseller and award winner. Following this, Fisher became widely
            known in Hollywood for her screenwriting and working on other
            writers’ screenplays as a script doctor, including many of the
            scripts from the <i>Star Wars </i>franchise (Bauer, 2022). <br />
            <br />
            In December 2016, Fisher was reported to have stopped breathing due
            to a medical emergency on a transatlantic flight from London to Los
            Angeles. After four days in intensive care, Fisher passed away at
            the age of 60 (Bose, 2020).

            Fisher was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at the age of 24. Around
            the time of <i>Return of the Jedi’s</i> release in 1983, Fisher
            began to notice that she had become increasingly dependent on drug
            use. After months of sobriety, she accidentally overdosed on a
            combination of prescription medication and sleeping pills in 1985.
            According to Fisher, following her diagnosis, “drugs made [her] feel
            more normal.” She stated that “having had this illness [her] entire
            life, [she] accommodated it by developing a very big personality.”
            Fisher often remarked that she wrote about her diagnosis a lot to
            make light of it as a way of survival (Bose, 2020).
            <br />
            <br />
            According to Fisher’s interview with <i>bp Magazine</i>, following
            her diagnosis she remained casual about talk therapy and
            noncommittal about medication, but she abandoned treatment in the
            late 1990s, following her breakup with talent agent Brian Lourd
            (Stephens, 2020b). This led her to experience an intense array of
            symptoms, including “the heady energy of mania, the self-absorption,
            the sleepless nights, the talking jags when she’d keep people on the
            phone for hours — and, inevitably, the soul-shriveling drops into
            depression.” (Stephens, 2020b). Fisher was ultimately hospitalized
            following a psychotic break in 1997.
            <br />
            <br />
            Fisher has been very open about her experiences with bipolar
            disorder. In her interview with <i>bp Magazine</i>, she shared that
            she occasionally powered through her mood episodes, such as enduring
            a depressive episode while working on <i>Wishful Drinking.</i> In
            other instances, her mood episodes have been involuntarily displayed
            to the public: a 2013 video was widely publicized showing Fisher
            “losing focus and rambling while performing on a Caribbean cruise
            ship” (Stephens, 2020a). Fisher later stated that she had been in a
            very severe manic state, bordering on psychosis. According to her,
            she “screwed up on [her] medications, and stopped sleeping, and
            couldn’t stop talking or writing” (Stephens, 2020a).
            <br />
            <br />
            Fisher has also been vocal about the importance of a strong support
            system in her life, and how her close family members and friends
            have adjusted to and been able to support her. In particular,
            Fisher’s daughter, Billie Lourd, grew up “on permanent alert” for
            signs that her mother was slipping into a manic episode: “reckless
            behavior, overeating, overspending, irritability, and bouts of
            anger” (Stephens, 2020a). On the other hand, Fisher’s recurring
            bouts of medication, which she described as “medication-proof and
            bullet-proof,” led her to be a fan of regular ECT (Stephens, 2020a).
